# --- Input

# name = input('What is your name? ')
# fav_color = input('What is your favorite color? ')
# print(name + ' likes ' + fav_color)


# --- Type Conversion

# birth_year = input('Birth year: ')
# print(type(birth_year))
# age = 2022 - int(birth_year)
# print(type(age))
# print(age)

# weight_lbs = input('What is your weight? (in pounds) ')
# print(type(weight_lbs))
# weight_kg = float(weight_lbs) * 0.453592
# print(type(weight_kg))
# print(weight_kg)

# --- Strings

# Examples when using double quote vs. single quote
# course = "Python's Course for Beginners"
# print(course)

# course_2 = 'Python for "Beginners"'
# print(course_2)

# course_3 = '''
# Hi John,
# Here is our first email to you.
#
# Thank you,
# '''
# print(course_3)

# course_4 = 'Python for Beginners'
# print(course_4[0])  # index of first character
# print(course_4[-1])  # index of last character
# print(course_4[0:3])  # return first character to third character
# print(course_4[0:])   # return all characters starting at first index
# print(course_4[:5])   # return all characters up to fifth character
#
# another = course_4[:]  # return all characters from course_4 variable
# print(another)

# name = 'Jennifer'
# print(name[1:-1])  # returns character starting from index one, all the way to end but excluding the last index


# --- Formatted Strings

# non-formatted string
# first_name = 'John'
# last_name = 'Smith'
# message = first_name + ' [' + last_name + '] is a coder'
# print(message)

# formatted string
# first_name = 'John'
# last_name = 'Smith'
# msg = f'{first_name} [{last_name}] is a coder'
# print(msg)


# --- String Methods
# For example, upper() is a function that belongs to strings object exclusively, so it is a method
# print() and len() are general purpose functions that are not specific to any type of object, so they are not methods

course = 'Python for Beginners'
print(len(course))
course.upper()
